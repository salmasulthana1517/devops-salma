# To check the connetivity between slaves
ansible all -m ping
ansible all -m ping -i ansible_hosts

# How to gather facts of slave machine
ansible all -m setup

# Tips: -i is used if we are using more than one invertory file 


# What if you do not have SSH key-based? How to pass username and password?
ansible all -m ping --user=ansadm --ask-pass

# TO checkthe uptime of a slave machine
ansible all -a uptime

# Tips: -m is the module and -a should contain the command it should run which goes as an argument to command and shell.

# check the free memory or memory usage of  host
ansible all -a "free -m" 

# Execute a command as root user (sudo) on host
ansible all -m shell -a "cat /etc/passwd|grep -i ansadm" -s --ask-sudo-pass

# Execute a command using become module
ansible all -m shell -a "cat /etc/passwd|grep -i ansadm" -b -K

# Tips: -b is the option for become and by default it will become root user
        â€“K is to tell ansible to ask for SUDO password

#Execute a command as a different user  (sudo su)
ansible all -m file -a "path=/home/ansadm/test state=directory mode=0755" -b --become-user=ansadm

# Create a Linux user group
ansible all -s -m group -a "name=test state=present" -b -K

# Create a file with 755 permission
ansible all -m file -a "path=/home/asnadm/testfile state=touch mode=0755"

# Change ownership of a file
ansible all -m file -a "path=/home/ansadm group=weblogic owner=weblogic" -b

# Install a package using yum command
ansible all -m yum -a "name=httpd state=installed"

# Start or stop the service
# To Start
ansible all -m service -a "name=httpd state=started" enabled=yes"

# To Stop
ansible all -m service -a "name=httpd state=stop" enabled=yes"


## configuration of ansible with public ip [or] private ip as our wish both are work
## connect to your ansible master instance 
 sudo su
 python --version
 yum -y install ansible
 ansible --version

## important vi edit in ansible configuration
 vi /etc/ansible/hosts
add our all node group are separate node group like this in this vi edit
 [all]
 13.234.122.78  (pub ip or private ip)
 3.6.38.93      (pub ip or private ip)
 [node-01]
 13.234.122.78  (pub ip or private ip)
 [node-02]
 3.6.38.93      (pub ip or private ip)

vi /etc/ansible/ansible.cfg
 inventory      = /etc/ansible/hosts
 sudo_user      = root
[ here uncommit this both ]

#for creating users
 useradd username
 passwd username
 type password:
 retype password:
#add user in sudoers file with root priviliages
vi /etc/sudoers     (or) other command   visudo

 username ALL=(ALL)    NOPASSWD: ALL

vi /etc/ssh/sshd_config
 PermitRootLogin yes
 PasswordAuthentication yes
 #PermitEmptyPasswords no
 #PasswordAuthentication no

systemctl restart sshd

#to create a keygen in ansible master 
#switch to user 
 su - username
 ssh-keygen  (or) ssh-keygen -t rsa
 enter 
 enter
 enter
=> our keygen create at this location    /home/ansible/.ssh/   
   cd /home/ansible/.ssh/
   ls   [3 files are showing]
   authorized_keys   id_rsa   id_rsa.pub

##  to copy our public key any other instance 
 ssh-copy-id user name of that instance@pubip of that instance or private ip
ex:-  ssh-copy-id username@3.109.183.147 
our ansible master public key copied in node instance
