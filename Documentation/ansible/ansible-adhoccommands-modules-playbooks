1).Ad-hoc commands  (Simple Linux Commands) there is no idenpotency
2).Modules          (single command) in  {YAML Language} idenpotency is present
3).Playbooks        (more than one module is called playbook) in {YAML Language}

Ad-hoc commands are commands which can be run individually to perform quick functions..

These Ad-hoc commands are not used for configuration management and deployment, beacuase these commands are of one time usage..

The ansible Ad-hoc commands uses the /usr/bin/ansible command line tool to automate a single task..

1). ansible Ad-hoc commands pattern---->

go to ansible server------> try this commands

[ansible@ip]# ansible groupname -a "ls" 
[ansible@ip]# ansible groupname[0] -a "touch file"
[ansible@ip]# ansible all -a "touch filey"
[ansible@ip]# ansible groupname -a "ls -a"
[ansible@ip]# ansible groupname -a "sudo yum install httpd -y"
[ansible@ip]# ansible groupname -ba "yum install httpd -y"
[ansible@ip]# ansible groupname -ba "yum remove httpd -y"
[ansible@ip]# ansible groupname[0] -ba "yum remove httpd -y"
[ansible@ip]# ansible groupname[0:1] -ba "yum remove httpd -y"

-a is a argument -b is a for sudo


2). ansdible modules----->

--> ansible ships with a number of modules (valled module library) that can be executed directery on remote hosts or through 'playbooks'
your library of modules can reside on any machine, and there are no servers, doemons, or databases requied
where ansible modules are stored?

the default location for the inventory file is /etc/ansible/hosts

ansible modules commands pattern----->

go to ansible server------> try this commands

[ansible@ip]# ansible groupname -b -m yum -a "pkg=httpd state=present"
[ansible@ip]# ansible groupname -b -m yum -a "pkg=httd state=latest"
[ansible@ip]# ansible groupname -b -m yum -a "pkg=httd state=absent"
[ansible@ip]# ansible groupname -b -m service -a "name=httpd state=started"
[ansible@ip]# ansible groupname -b -m user -a "name=raj"
[ansible@ip]# ansible groupname -b -m copy -a "src=file4 dest=/tmp"
[ansible@ip]# ansible groupname[0] -b -m copy -a "src=file4 dest=/tmp"
[ansible@ip]# ansible groupname[0:1] -b -m copy -a "src=file4 dest=/tmp"
[ansible@ip]# ansible groupname -m setup 
[ansible@ip]# ansible groupname -m setup -a "filter=*ipv4*"
