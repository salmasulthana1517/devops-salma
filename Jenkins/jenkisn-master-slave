Configure Jenkins Slaves on AWS EC2
Jenkins is a self-contained Java-based program, ready to run out-of-the-box, with packages for Windows, Mac OS X and other Unix-like operating systems. As an extensible automation server, Jenkins can be used as a simple CI server or turned into the continuous delivery hub for any project.

Prerequisites
1.	Jenkins Master Running Get help here
2.	EC2 RHEL 7.x Instance - for Slave Node Get help here
->	With Internet Access
->	Security Group with Port 8080 open for internet
->	Java v1.8.x
#Install Java
#We will be using open java for our demo, Get latest version from http://openjdk.java.net/install/. Also configure the default JAVA_HOME path
1)  yum install java-1.8*
        (or)
2)  yum -y install java-1.8.0-openjdk
3)  java -version
4) find /usr/lib/jvm/java-1.8* | head -n 3
#JAVA_HOME=/usr/lib/jvm/java-1.8.0-openjdk-1.8.0.191.b12-1.el7_6.x86_64
# To set it permanently update your .bash_profile
6) vi .bash_profile
#Sample Example of .bahs_profile file:
====================================
# .bash_profile
	

# Get the aliases and functions
if [ -f ~/.bashrc ]; then
        . ~/.bashrc
fi
	

# User specific environment and startup programs
JAVA_HOME=/usr/lib/jvm/java-1.8.0-openjdk-1.8.0.232.b09-2.el8_1.x86_64
PATH=$PATH:$HOME/bin:$JAVA_HOME/bin
	

export PATH
=========================================================================
#Restart the .bash_profile to reflect the changes.
7) source ~/.bash_profile

#Setup Jenkins Slave
====================
# Create user and add the user to wheel group
useradd jenkins-slave-01
# Create SSH Keys
sudo su - jenkins-slave-01
ssh-keygen -t rsa -N "" -f /home/jenkins-slave-01/.ssh/id_rsa
# The private and public keys will be created at these locations `/home/jenkins-slave-01/.ssh/id_rsa` and `/home/jenkins-slave-01/.ssh/id_rsa.pub`
cd .ssh
cat id_rsa.pub > authorized_keys
chmod 700 authorized_keys

Configuration on Master
========================
Copy the slave node's public key[id_rsa.pub] to Master Node's known_hosts file
mkdir -p /var/lib/jenkins/.ssh
cd /var/lib/jenkins/.ssh
ssh-keyscan -H SLAVE-NODE-IP-OR-HOSTNAME >>/var/lib/jenkins/.ssh/known_hosts
# ssh-keyscan -H 172.31.38.42 >>/var/lib/jenkins/.ssh/known_hosts
chown jenkins:jenkins known_hosts
#we need to change the owner as we ran ssh-keyscan command using “root” user.
# default user of Jenkins will be “jenkins”
chmod 700 known_hosts
# DOne !!
